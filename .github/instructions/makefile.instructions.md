# Makefile review instructions

- Makefile targets should have matching `.PHONY` declarations when they are not real files.
- Avoid adding flags that are already defaults.
- Keep task names aligned with CI workflow usage.
- Build targets should validate the library with `go build ./...`; do not assume a CLI binary exists.
- Preserve the `coverage-check` target and its 90% default floor so `make test` fails when total coverage drops below the project threshold.
